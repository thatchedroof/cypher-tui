    Tier 6: [[[Energize Crowd|ability {}]]] or [[[Overcharge Device|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Fire Tendrils|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Fire Servant|ability {}]]] or [[[Inferno Trail|ability {}]]]

# Blazes With Radiance

    Tier 1: [[[Enlightened|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Illuminating Touch|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Force Wall|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Bouncing Shield|ability {}]]] or [[[Shield Burst|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: The shield is temporarily lost. A foe temporarily ends up with the shield.

# Builds Robots

Your robotic creations do as they are commanded.

    The word “robot” is used in this focus, though the robot you create might look very different from one created by someone else, depending on the genre. Steampunk robots, organic robots, or even magical golems are all feasible “robots.”

    Tier 1: [[[Robot Assistant|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Robot Builder|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Robot Control|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Expert Follower|ability {}]]] or [[[Skill With Defense|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Further Mathematics|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Knowing the Unknown|ability {}]]] or [[[Greater Enhanced Intellect|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Too many predicted results threaten to overwhelm and stun the character. A result points to imminent disaster.

# Channels Divine Blessings

A devout follower of a divine being, you channel some of your deity’s power to achieve wonders.

    Tier 5: [[[Divine Intervention|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Divine Symbol|ability {}]]] or [[[Summon Demon|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Precognition|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Mind Control|ability {}]]] or [[[Telepathic Network|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Something glimpsed in the target’s mind is horrifying. A feedback loop allows the target to read the character’s mind.

# Conducts Weird Science

Your preternatural insight and ability make you a scientist capable of amazing feats.

    Tier 1: [[[Lab Analysis|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Knowledge Skills|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Weird Science Breakthrough|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Incredible Feat of Science|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Inventor|ability {}]]] or [[[Defensive Field|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Creations get out of control. Side effects cannot always be predicted. Weird science terrifies people and can draw the media. When a device created or modified by weird science is depleted, it detonates.

# Consorts With the Dead

The dead answer your questions, and their reanimated corpses serve you.

    Tier 1: [[[Speaker for the Dead|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Necromancy|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Terrifying Gaze|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[True Necromancy|ability {}]]] or [[[Word of Death|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Beast Call|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[As If One Creature|ability {}]]] or [[[Control the Savage|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: The community is reluctant to welcome dangerous animals. Out-of-control beasts become a real hazard.

    Tier 4: [[[Field of Gravity|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Flight|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Improved Gravity Cleave|ability {}]]] or [[[Weight of the World|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Onlookers react with unreasoning fear. A weird interaction sends an ally or object careening into the sky.

# Copies Superpowers

You can copy others’ skills, abilities, and superpowers.

    Tier 1: [[[Flex Skill|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Flex Skill|ability {}]]]

    Tier 4: [[[Improved Copying|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Power Memory|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Amazing Copying|ability {}]]] or [[[Multiple|ability {}]]]

Copying GM Intrusions: A copied power ends unexpectedly or goes out of control. A copied power doesn’t bring secondary powers with it (like gaining superspeed without protection from air friction, or not being immune to the heat from your own fire bolts).

# Crafts Illusions

You fashion images from light that are so perfect they seem real.

    Tier 1: [[[Minor Illusion|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Illusory Disguise|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Cast Illusion|ability {}]]] or [[[Major Illusion|ability {}]]]
    Tier 4: [[[Illusory Selves|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Terrifying Image|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Grandiose Illusion|ability {}]]] or [[[Permanent Illusion|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: The illusion isn’t believable. The illusion is pierced at just the wrong moment.

# Crafts Unique Objects

You’re an inventor of strange and useful objects.

    Tier 1: [[[Crafter|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Master Identifier|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Artifact Tinkerer|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Quick Work|ability {}]]]

    Tier 4: [[[Cyphersmith|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Innovator|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Inventor|ability {}]]] or [[[Fusion Armor|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: The object malfunctions, breaks, or suffers catastrophic or unexpected failure.

    Cyphersmith works only in a setting where the cyphers are physical objects. If this isn’t the case, this ability should probably be replaced with something akin to Weird Science Breakthrough from the Conducts Weird Science focus.

You can manipulate shadow and “dark” matter.

    Tier 1: [[[Ribbons of Dark Matter|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Void Wings|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Windwracked Traveler|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Dark Matter Structure|ability {}]]] or [[[Embrace the Night|ability {}]]]

    Tier 4: [[[Greater Enhanced Might|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Reinforcing Field|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Generate Force Field|ability {}]]] or [[[Stun Attack|ability {}]]]

    Tier 1: [[[Courageous|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Warding Shield|ability {}]]]

    Tier 4: [[[Combat Challenge|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Willing Sacrifice|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Resuscitate|ability {}]]] or [[[True Defender|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: A character focused on protecting others may periodically leave themselves vulnerable to attacks.

    Tier 5: [[[Asserting Your Privilege|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Able Assistance|ability {}]]] or [[[Mind of a Leader|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Debts incurred by a family are owed by the character. A long-lost sibling seeks to disinherit rivals. An assassin finds the character.

# Doesn’t Do Much

You’re a slacker, but you know a little about a lot of things.

    Tier 1: [[[Life Lessons|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Totally Chill|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Skill With Attacks|ability {}]]] or [[[Improvise|ability {}]]]
    Tier 4: [[[Life Lessons|ability {}]]]
    Tier 4: [[[Greater Skill With Defense|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Greater Enhanced Potential|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6 Drawing on Life’s Experiences or Quick Wits

GM Intrusions: New situations are confounding and stressful. Past actions (or inactions) come back to haunt the character.

# Drives Like A Maniac

Whether balancing on two wheels, jumping another vehicle, or driving head-on toward an oncoming enemy car, you don’t think about the risks when you’re behind the wheel.

(Someone who Drives Like a Maniac needs access to a vehicle.)

    Tier 1: [[[Driver|ability {}]]]

# Emerged From the Obelisk

Your body, hard as crystal, gives you a suite of unique abilities, gained after an interaction with a floating crystalline obelisk.

    Tier 1: [[[Crystalline Body|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Hover|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Inhabit Crystal|ability {}]]] or [[[Immovable|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Command Metal|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Diamagnetism|ability {}]]] or [[[Iron Punch|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: The metal twists, bends, or produces shrapnel. A lapse in concentration might cause something to slip or drop at just the wrong time.

You perform, mostly for the benefit of others.

    Tier 1: [[[Levity|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Inspiring Ease|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Coordinated Effort|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Multiplicity|ability {}]]] or [[[Resilient Duplicate|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Perceiving the world from two different places disorients the character, causing momentary vertigo, nausea, or confusion.

# Exists Partially Out of Phase

A bit translucent, you’re slightly out of phase and can move through solid objects.

    Tier 1: [[[Walk Through Walls|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Defensive Phasing|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Phased Attack|ability {}]]] or [[[Phase Door|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Using the Environment|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Twisting the Knife|ability {}]]] or [[[Murderer|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Not Dead Yet|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Burning Light|ability {}]]] or [[[Ignore Affliction|ability {}]]]

    Tier 4: [[[Short Teleportation|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Medium Teleportation|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Teleportation|ability {}]]] or [[[Teleportive Wound|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: A teleport goes awry, landing the character in a dangerous place. Inertia (such as from falling) continues through the teleport, injuring the character.

# Infiltrates

Subtlety, guile, and stealth allow you to get in where others can’t.

    Tier 1: [[[Stealth Skills|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Sense Attitudes|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Evasion|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Brainwashing|ability {}]]] or [[[Spring Away|ability {}]]]

    Tier 1: [[[Opening Statement|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Knowledge of the Law|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Debate|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[No One Knows Better|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Greater Enhanced Potential|ability {}]]] or [[[Legal Intern|ability {}]]]

    Tier 1: [[[Celebrity Talent|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Do You Know Who I Am?|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Transcend the Script|ability {}]]] or [[[Improved Companion|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Fans are endangered or hurt on your behalf. Someone in your entourage betrays you. Your show, tour, contract, or other event is canceled. The media posts photos of you in an embarrassing situation.

# Is Licensed to Carry

You carry a gun and you know how to use it in a fight.

    Although Is Licensed to Carry is designed with modern firearms in mind, it could apply to flintlock weapons, futuristic laser blasters, or other ranged weapons.

    Tier 1: [[[Gunner|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Practiced With Guns|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Careful Shot|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Trained Gunner|ability {}]]] or [[[Damage Dealer|ability {}]]]
    Tier 4: [[[Snap Shot|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Arc Spray|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Special Shot|ability {}]]] or [[[Lethal Damage|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Misfire or jam! The attack fails and the action is lost, plus an additional action is needed to fix the problem.

# Is Wanted by the Law

“WANTED, DEAD OR ALIVE” posters (or their equivalent) have appeared featuring your face. It’s up to you whether it’s a mistake that snowballed out of control or you actually would kill someone just for looking at you.

    Tier 1: [[[Enhanced Speed|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Danger Sense|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Surprise Attack|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Outlaw Reputation|ability {}]]] or [[[Successive Attack|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Band of Desperados|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Not Dead Yet|ability {}]]] or [[[Lethal Damage|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Most people do not take well to discovering a wanted outlaw in their midst.

# Keeps a Magic Ally

An allied magic creature bound to an object (such as a minor djinn in a lamp, or a ghost in a pipe) is your friend, protector, and weapon.

    Tier 1: [[[Bound Magic Creature|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Object Bond|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Hidden Closet|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Minor Wish|ability {}]]] or [[[Mount|ability {}]]]
    Tier 4: [[[Improved Object Bond|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Moderate Wish|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Object Bond Mastery|ability {}]]] or [[[Trust to Luck|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: The creature unexpectedly disappears into its bound object. The bound object cracks. The creature disagrees and doesn’t do as asked. The creature says it’s leaving unless a task is performed for it.

# Leads

Your natural leadership capability allows you to command others, including a loyal band of followers.

    Tier 1: [[[Natural Charisma|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Good Advice|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Enhanced Potential|ability {}]]]

    Tier 6: [[[Band of Followers|ability {}]]] or [[[Mind of a Leader|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Followers fail, betray, lie, become corrupted, get kidnapped, or die.

# Learns Quickly

You deal with bad situations as they arise, learning new lessons each time.

    Tier 1: [[[Enhanced Intellect|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[There’s Your Problem|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Enhanced Intellect|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Learned a Few Things|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Two Things at Once|ability {}]]] or [[[Skill With Defense|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Accidents and mistakes are great teachers.

You can survive in badlands where others perish.

    Tier 1: [[[Wilderness Life|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Enhanced Might|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Living Off the Land|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Wilderness Explorer|ability {}]]]

    Tier 4: [[[Wilderness Awareness|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[The Wild Is on Your Side|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[One With the Wild|ability {}]]] or [[[Wild Camouflage|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: People in cities and towns sometimes disparage those who look (and smell) like they live in the wilds, as if they were ignorant or barbaric.

# Looks for Trouble

You’re a scrapper and love a good fight.

    Tier 1: [[[Fists of Fury|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Wound Tender|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Mastery With Attacks|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Greater Enhanced Might|ability {}]]] or [[[Lethal Damage|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Weapons break or fly from even the strongest grip. Brawlers trip and fall. Even the battlefield can work against you with things falling or collapsing.

# Loves the Void

When it’s just you, your spacesuit, and the panorama of stars wheeling out forever and always, you are at peace.

Type Swap Option: Have Spacesuit, Will Travel

    Tier 1: [[[Vacuum Skilled|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Microgravity Adept|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Enhanced Speed Edge|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Enhanced Physique|ability {}]]]

    Tier 4: [[[Push Off and Throw|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Microgravity Avoidance|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Weightless Shot|ability {}]]] or [[[Reactive Field|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Spacesuits develop glitches. Air refill cartridges sometimes misreport capacity. Micrometeorites are common in space.

You use protective equipment and practiced techniques to avoid becoming hurt in a fight.

    Tier 1: [[[Shield Master|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Sturdy|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Nothing but Defend|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Defense Master|ability {}]]] or [[[Wear It Well|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Shields break when hit, as do weapons used to parry. Armor straps break.

# Masters Spells

By specializing in spellcasting and keeping a spellbook, you can quickly cast spells of arcing lightning, rolling fire, creeping shadow, and summoning.

    Tier 1: [[[Arcane Flare|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Ray of Confusion|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Fire Bloom|ability {}]]] or [[[Summon Giant Spider|ability {}]]]
    Tier 4: [[[Soul Interrogation|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Granite Wall|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Summon Demon|ability {}]]] or [[[Word of Death|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: The spell goes wrong. The summoned creature turns on the caster. A rival spellcaster is drawn to the magic use.

# Masters the Swarm

Insects. Rats. Bats. Even birds. You master one type of small creature that obeys you.

    Tier 1: [[[Influence Swarm|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Control Swarm|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Living Armor|ability {}]]] or [[[Skill With Attacks|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Gain Unusual Companion|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Deadly Swarm|ability {}]]] or [[[Skill With Defense|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: A command is misunderstood. Control is erratic or is lost. Bites and stings are not uncommon for masters of the swarm.

# Masters Weaponry

You are a master user of a particular type of weapon, be it a sword, whip, dagger, gun, or something else.

(Someone who Masters Weaponry might have additional equipment, including a high- quality weapon.)

    Tier 1: [[[Weapon Master|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Weapon Crafter|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Weapon Defense|ability {}]]]

    Tier 1: [[[Make Judgment|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Designation|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Defend the Innocent|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Improved Designation|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Punish All the Guilty|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Damn the Guilty|ability {}]]] or [[[Inspire the Innocent|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Guilt or innocence can be complicated. Some people resent the presumption of a self-appointed judge. Passing judgment makes enemies.

# Moves Like a Cat

Lithe, flexible, and graceful, you move quickly and smoothly, and never seem to be where danger is.

    Tier 1: [[[Greater Enhanced Speed|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Balance|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Movement Skills|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Safe Fall|ability {}]]]

    Tier 4: [[[Quick Strike|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Slippery|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Perfect Speed Burst|ability {}]]] or [[[Greater Enhanced Speed|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Even a cat can be clumsy. A jump isn’t quite as easy as it looks. An escape move is so overzealous that it sends the character right into harm’s way.

# Moves Like the Wind

You can move so fast that you become a blur.

    Tier 1: [[[Greater Enhanced Speed|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Fleet of Foot|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Hard to See|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Perfect Speed Burst|ability {}]]] or [[[Incredible Running Speed|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Surfaces can be slick or offer hidden obstacles. The movement of other creatures can be unpredictable, and the character might run into them.

# Murders

You’re an assassin, whether by trade, by inclination, or because it was that or be killed yourself. (Someone who Murders might have additional equipment, including three doses of a level 2 blade poison that inflicts 5 points of damage.)

    Tier 1: [[[Assassin Skills|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Quick Death|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Infiltrator|ability {}]]]

    Tier 4: [[[Better Surprise Attack|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Damage Dealer|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Escape Plan|ability {}]]] or [[[Murderer|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Most people do not react well to a professional killer.

    Tier 1: [[[Flesh of Stone|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Advantage to Disadvantage|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Unarmed Fighting Style|ability {}]]]

    Tier 4: [[[Divert Attacks|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Stun Attack|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Master of Unarmed Fighting Style|ability {}]]] or [[[Lethal Damage|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Striking certain foes hurts you as much as it hurts them. Opponents with weapons have greater reach. Complicated martial arts moves can knock you off balance.

# Never Says Die

You never quit, can shrug off a beating, and always come back for more.

    Tier 1: [[[Improved Recovery|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Push on Through|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Ignore the Pain|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Blood Fever|ability {}]]] or [[[Hidden Reserves|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Not Dead Yet|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Final Defiance|ability {}]]] or [[[Ignore Affliction|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Sometimes, it’s equipment or weapons that give out.

# Operates Undercover

Under the guise of someone else, you seek to find answers the powerful do not want divulged.

(Someone who Operates Undercover might have additional equipment that includes a disguise kit.)

    Tier 1: [[[Investigate|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Disguise|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Agent Provocateur|ability {}]]] or [[[Run and Fight|ability {}]]]
    Tier 4: [[[Pull a Fast One|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Using What’s Available|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Trust to Luck|ability {}]]] or [[[Deadly Strike|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Bad luck can ruin the best plans. Disguises fail. Allies are revealed to be agents, too.

# Performs Feats of Strength

A muscled prodigy, you can haul incredible weight, hurl your body through the air, and punch through doors.

    Tier 1: [[[Athlete|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Enhanced Might Edge|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Feat of Strength|ability {}]]]
    Tier 3: [[[Iron Fist|ability {}]]] or [[[Throw|ability {}]]]

    Tier 6: [[[Incomparable Pilot|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Remote Control|ability {}]]] or [[[Skill With Attacks|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: Starcraft get lost, break down, and are attacked in space. An alien stowaway is found.

# Plays Too Many Games

Lessons, reflexes, and strategies you’ve learned by playing too many games have applications in the real world, where people who don’t play enough toil and live their dreary lives.

    Tier 1: [[[Game Lessons|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Gamer|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Zero Dark Eyes|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Resist Tricks|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Gamer’s Fortitude|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Mind Surge|ability {}]]] or [[[Gaming God|ability {}]]]

    Tier 1: [[[Frenzy|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Greater Enhanced Might|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Attack and Attack Again|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Greater Enhanced Potential|ability {}]]] or [[[Lethal Damage|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: It’s easy for a berserker to lose control and attack friend as well as foe.

# Rides the Lightning

You create and discharge electrical power.

    Tier 1: [[[Shock|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Charge|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Bolt Rider|ability {}]]]

    Tier 4: [[[Movement Skills|ability {}]]]
    Tier 5: [[[Lost in the Chaos|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Duel to the Death|ability {}]]] or [[[Successive Attack|ability {}]]]

GM Intrusions: The dangers of the high seas are many, including severe storms and disease. Other pirates sometimes get ahead through betrayal. A pirate tracks down former sailing mates to find hidden treasure.

# Scavenges

When not running and hiding, you sift the ruins of civilization for useful remnants to ensure your survival.

    Tier 1: [[[Post-Apocalyptic Survivor|ability {}]]]
    Tier 1: [[[Ruin Lore|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[Junkmonger|ability {}]]]

    Tier 6: [[[Artifact Scavenger|ability {}]]] or [[[Reactive Field|ability {}]]]

    Tier 5: [[[Evasion|ability {}]]]
    Tier 6: [[[Greater Skill With Attacks|ability {}]]] or [[[Protective Wall|ability {}]]]

# Siphons Power

You suck power out of machines and creatures alike in order to empower yourself.

# Stands Like a Bastion

Your armor, along with your size, strength, incredible training, or machine enhancement, makes you difficult to move or hurt.

GM Intrusions: The character unexpectedly changes form. An NPC is frightened by or aggressive toward the shapeshifter. The transformation takes longer than expected.

# Travels Through Time

You can see through time, try to reach through it, and eventually even travel through it.

    Although all character choices are subject to GM approval, Travels Through Time is a focus that the GM and player should probably have a long conversation about ahead of time, so the player knows the rules of time travel (if any) that exist in the GM’s setting. A character with this focus can drastically alter a setting, if the rules of time travel allow it.

    Tier 1: [[[Anticipation|ability {}]]]
    Tier 2: [[[See History|ability {}]]]
