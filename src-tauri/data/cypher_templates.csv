Cypher System Reference Document,Secret,1,6,2,"<p>The user can ask the GM one question and get a general answer.
The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer,
the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that a PC could find
by looking somewhere other than their current location is level 1, and
obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the
future is level 10, and such knowledge is always open to interpretation.
The cypher cannot provide an answer to a question above its level.</p>

healing is more difficult during this time; all recovery rolls suffer a
–1 penalty.</p>

Cypher System Reference Document,Skill Boost,1,6,0,"<p>Dramatically but temporarily alters the user’s mind and body so
they can ease one specific kind of physical action by three steps. Once
activated, this boost can be used a number of times equal to the
cypher’s level, but only within a twenty-four-hour period. The boost
takes effect each time the action is performed. For example, a level 3
cypher boosts the first three times that action is attempted. Roll a
d100 to determine the action.</p>

Cypher System Reference Document,Slave Maker,1,6,2,"<p>To activate the cypher, the user must succeed on a melee attack
against a creature about the size of the user and whose level does not
exceed the cypher’s level. The cypher bonds to the target, who
immediately becomes calm. The target awaits the user’s commands and
carries out all orders to the best of its ability. The target remains so
enslaved for a number of hours equal to the cypher’s level minus the
target’s level. (If the result is 0, the target is enslaved for only one
minute.)</p>

for less nefarious purposes, such as hunting prey and sneaking past
enemies.)</p>

Cypher System Reference Document,Spatial Warp,1,6,4,"<p>When affixed to a device that affects a single target at range,
that range is increased to 1 mile (1.5 km) with no penalties. Space is

8 creature. The object moves at great speed, mapping and scanning an
unknown area. It moves 500 feet (150 m) per level, scanning an area up
to 50 feet (15 m) away from it. It identifies basic layout, creatures,
and major energy sources. Its movement is blocked by any physical or
energy barrier. At the end of its mapping run, it returns to the user
and reports. If it discovers a predefined target during its run (such as
“a creature of level 5 or higher,” “a locked door,” “a major energy

Cypher System Reference Document,Subdual Field,1,6,3,"<p>Two rounds after being activated, the device creates an
invisible field that fills a specified area (such as a cube a short
distance across) within long range. The field lasts for one minute. It
affects the minds of thinking beings within the field, preventing them
from taking hostile actions. The effect lasts as long as they remain in
the field and for 1d6 rounds after, although an Intellect defense roll
is allowed each round to act normally (both in the field and after

Cypher System Reference Document,Vanisher,1,6,2,"<p>The user becomes invisible for five minutes per cypher level,
during which time they are specialized in stealth and Speed defense
