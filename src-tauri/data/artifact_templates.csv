CSRD Fantasy,Angelic Ward,1,6,2,Tiny figurine of a winged angel,"<p>Once activated, the figurine’s spirit emerges and becomes
semisolid as a glowing, human-sized winged angel. It follows within 3
feet (1 m) of the figurine owner. Anything within long range that
attacks the owner is attacked by the angelic ward, which sends out a
bolt of flesh-rotting energy, doing damage equal to the artifact’s
level. Once activated, it functions for a day.</p>

CSRD Fantasy,Ring of Dragon’s Flight,1,6,2,Green iron ring that appears like a dragon wound around the finger,"<p>When the wearer activates the ring, dragon wings unfurl from
their back, and for one minute the wearer can fly up to long range. The
ring does not confer the ability to hover or make fine adjustments while
in flight.</p>
",1,10,,
CSRD Fantasy,Soulflaying Weapon,1,6,1,"Weapon of any type, with engraved glowing runes denoting
soulflaying","<p>This weapon functions as a normal weapon of its kind. The
wielder can use an action to activate its soulflaying magic for one
minute. During that time, if the weapon scores a hit, it inflicts normal
damage, plus 3 additional points of Intellect damage on all creatures
that have souls (not automatons, mindless undead, or the like).</p>
",1,100,,
CSRD Fantasy,Spellbook of the Amber Mage,1,6,0,Weighty tome bound in amber filled with pages of spell runes,"<p>When the user incants from the spellbook and succeeds at a level
3 Intellect-based task, the user can attempt to trap a creature within
long range inside a block of amber. Only creatures whose level is equal
to or lower than the artifact’s level can be targeted. A creature
successfully caught is preserved in perfect stasis until the encasing
amber is broken away (the amber has 10 points of health per level of the
artifact).</p>
",1,20,,
CSRD Fantasy,Wand of Firebolts,1,6,2,"Wand of red wood 8 inches (20 cm) long, carved with intricate
flamelike images","<p>When activated, the wand looses a blast of fire at a chosen
target within short range, inflicting damage equal to the artifact’s
level.</p>
",1,20,,
CSRD Science Fiction,Amber Casement,1,6,4,"Series of short, rounded tubes and hoses about 12 inches (30 cm)
long","<p>The device solidifies the air in a 10-foot (3 m) cube of space,
the center of which must be within short range. The air is turned into
an amberlike substance, and those trapped in it will likely suffocate or
starve.</p>
",4,6,,
CSRD Science Fiction,Metabolism Bud,1,6,0,"Organic pod, almost like a small, hemispherical bit of brain; once
grafted to a host, the host’s flesh grows over the pod until it is only
a lump","<p>The pod grafts onto any living host (usually near the brain or
spine) and injects chemicals that boost the creature’s metabolism. This
permanently raises the host’s Speed Pool maximum by 5 points.</p>
",0,0,,
CSRD Science Fiction,Mind Imager,1,6,2,"Handheld device with a plastic panel screen and wires that must be
affixed to the head of a creature","<p>This device shows a visual image of what a creature is thinking.
The affected creature need not be conscious.</p>
",1,20,,
CSRD Science Fiction,Psychic Crystal,1,6,4,Violet crystal the size of a fist,"<p>The crystal allows the user to transmit their thoughts
telepathically at an interstellar distance. Even at that range,
communication is instantaneous. Each use allows about a minute’s worth
of communication, and the communication is entirely one way (so having
two crystals would be handy).</p>
",1,10,,
CSRD Science Fiction,Repair Sphere,1,6,2,Small spherical automaton about 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter,"<p>This device comes with a small module that can be affixed to a
machine. Floating along, the sphere attempts to follow within immediate
range of the module (though it can be directed to remain where it is).
It moves a short distance each round. It can come to the module from a
range of up to 10 miles (16 km) away. If the module is attached to a
machine and that machine takes damage, the sphere moves to repair the
damage with sophisticated tools that restore 1d6 – 2 points per round
(meaning that if a 1 or 2 is rolled, no damage is repaired that round).
This requires no action on the part of the machine being repaired. The
sphere can attempt to repair a machine a number of times per day equal
to its level. The sphere must be newly activated each day.</p>
",1,100,,
CSRD Horror,Book of Inversion,0,0,8,"Very large book of ancient providence, the cover bound in iron and
wrapped in chains with a level 6 padlock","<p>When opened, the Book of Inversion shows a pair of pages that
detail a magic spell in the reader’s language, complete with disturbing
diagrams. The spell’s effect varies, but it is always some kind of
horrible attack—a target is driven mad, a target is turned inside out, a
target seeks to murder their best friend, several targets are cursed
with a rotting disease, and so forth. The reader can automatically cast
the spell as an action, one time only. More insidiously, if successful,
the spell confers pleasure to the caster and fully restores all of their
Pools. The caster must make an immediate Intellect defense roll or be
compelled to use the book (and thus a new spell) again the next day.
This compulsion is so strong that the caster will kill their dearest
loved one to complete the task. If they are unable to use the book
again, they are driven permanently mad. Woe to the caster who uses the
book on the last time before it is depleted (at which point it crumbles
to dust).</p>
",1,10,,
CSRD Horror,Shadow Box,0,0,7,"Wooden and black metal box, about 12 inches by 7 inches by 3
inches (30 by 18 by 8 cm), with a hinged lid and a clasp","<p>When the box opens, shadows seethe out. These shadows coalesce
into a form that best represents a deep fear in the subconscious of the
person who opened the box. The opener must make an Intellect defense
roll to master the shadow thing, which then acts as a level 7 creature
under their control for five rounds before fading away. If the roll
fails, the creature attacks the opener and anyone else around. To make
matters worse, the opener spends the first round frozen in terror, doing
nothing.</p>
",2,6,,
CSRD Horror,Sphere 23,1,6,4,"A 7-inch (18 cm) sphere of what appears to be fluid metal, tinted
red","<p>Possibly one of a number of identical alien artifacts recovered
in remote locales across the earth, the so-called sphere 23 will grant a
wish to anyone who holds it and uses an action to concentrate on it. The
wish can be anything, including something that bends reality:
raising
the dead, altering time, and so forth. However, the wisher must
immediately make a Might defense roll or be consumed by the sphere. If
the roll succeeds, they must then make an Intellect defense roll or be
driven permanently and irrevocably mad.</p>
",3,6,,
CSRD Post-Apocalyptic,Autodoc,1,6,0,"Backpack-sized plastic module from which clamps, forceps,
scalpels, and needles can extend","<p>When strapped to a target (or when someone wearing the autodoc
is damaged), the autodoc activates and restores 1 point to a target’s
Pools each round for ten rounds or until the target is fully healed,
whichever happens first.</p>
",1,10,,
CSRD Post-Apocalyptic,Enviroscanner,1,6,0,Forearm-mounted computer tablet,"<p>This multifunction device can receive radio transmissions,
automatically map locations the wearer has visited, play various forms
of media, keep voice and written records, and provide an asset to any
task related to interfacing with other computerized systems or machines.
Also, the wearer can scan for specific materials, toxic traces, and life
forms within short range.</p>

CSRD Post-Apocalyptic,Military Exoskeleton,1,6,1,"Articulated metal struts with deformable padding and straps for
custom fit to a human frame","<p>For one hour per use (when the exoskeleton is powered on), the
wearer has +1 to their Speed Edge and +1 to their Might Edge.</p>
",1,10,,
CSRD Post-Apocalyptic,Rocket Fist,1,6,2,Metal gauntlet with flaring rocket exhaust nozzles,"<p>If the user activates the fist as part of an attack, the punch
gains a rocket assist. If the attack is successful, the fist inflicts
additional damage equal to the artifact level and throws the target back
a short distance.</p>
",1,10,,
CSRD Post-Apocalyptic,Rocket-Propelled Grenade,1,6,3,Tube with sight and trigger,"<p>The user can make a long-range attack with a rocket-propelled
grenade that inflicts 7 points of damage to the target and every
creature and object next to the target.</p>
",1,6,,
CSRD Post-Apocalyptic,Terahertz Scanner,1,6,1,Visor fitted with bulky electronics,"<p>By emitting terahertz and long-range infrared light, this device
allows a user to see a short distance through most interior walls of
standard structures, through normal clothing, and into normal bags and
briefcases. Only stone or concrete more than 6 inches (15 cm) thick
prevents a scan. Regardless, images are black and white and fuzzy, and
lack fine detail.</p>
